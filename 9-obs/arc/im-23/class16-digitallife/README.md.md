At its core Obsidian is not very complicated. And can be explained in one image below. There are only a few things that might be novel to you, when coming from MS word.

**Vault** | Folder. A folder that contains your notes with subfolders and files on one topic.

**Note** | File. A file in "markdown, .md" format, that you can open and edit with Obsidian, a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit. The title of the note will be the file name.

**Link** | Links between notes in obsidian are created by using brackets [[Name of Note to link]] and it not only allows you to click, but also to see which notes links where and who links back to it - a very powerful feature.

**Tag** | A tag or hashtag: #thisisatag . Obsidian will highlight it make it easy to find other notes with the same tag. Aside from a link it is a way to group and connect notes in Obsidian.

**MetaData** | Some machine readable data in a specific format. It helps with structure but is often irrelevant for the subject matter. For example "Year: 2019" or "DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-16381-2" are two pieces of meta data for a scientific paper. We can use this to create tables or lists automatically. (There are different ways of adding meta data)

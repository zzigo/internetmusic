**ooo** is a design schema that can be used as the pattern for new types of apps that don't differentiate between static and dynamic content. It leans on the philosophy of Graham Harman presented in his concept of the "quadruple object", a novel ontological schema that builds upon and refactors the work of Heidegger, Husserl, Whitehead and others to present a model for understanding being that does not distinguish _a priori_ between nature and culture, non-humans and humans. The attempt here is to port it into code as the structure for overcoming the divide between apps dedicated to largely static content, and those built for dynamic content.

The resurgence of the web in the early-aughts following the dot-com boom was largely predicated on the LAMP stack. This four-fold opensource techno-feast simultaneously allowed for the rapid deployment of blogging platforms for the dedicated novice, fueled by CMSs like Wordpress, and for the development of massive scalable proprietary platforms like Facebook. With the introduction of the XMLHttpRequest and AJAX, most notably with gmail in 2005, and the adoption of the REST protocol for API calls, the web was born anew as a host for apps. The subsequent explosion of content production, re-mixing and re-cycling through social media has been met with a new suite of tools that allow for DIRTy - Data-Intensive Real-Time - apps, notably Node.js built on the Google V8 Javascript Engine.

Progress in 2013 means carrying on with this trajectory, embodying this telos. While multiple parallel arrows of development are blazing ahead - such as vast improvements in rendering engines and increasingly powerful libraries for increasingly complex graphics leading to regular leaps in interface design - my concern is the movement from static to dynamic content. The development of Node.js provides key testimony to the claim I wish to make: while the Express framework has emerged as an industry standard, and daily more and more libraries are ported from other languages, and new bindings written for powerful C, Java and other compiled language programs, there is still no widely adopted CMS, nor does there seem to be a seed that is even worthy of being considered. To put it another way, the hottest new development workflow for the web has no standard for dealing with putting static content into a database.

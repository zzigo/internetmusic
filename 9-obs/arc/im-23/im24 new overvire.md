## javascript 

- just in time compiled scripting language
	- need s a runtime
- event-loop
- asynchonous
- single-threaded
- multi-parading
- ...no great for audio.

note: runtime is the program that let languajes "just-in-time" (js, java, python) to run the event-loop neccesary for UI and also for the self-compiling.
Node.js for example is a runtime outside of the browser.
The browser is also a runtime
js is single threaded, there is not parallelism.
But for that is used the asynchronous programs that goes out of the thread.

## API
its provides an interface to interact with closed code. 

### DOM API
	allow us to reference HTML elements within js elements.

## how it fits together


## Node.js
- server-side runtime for js
- it runs js outside the browser
- silmilat to the browser
- Atwood Law:
	- any application that can be written in js, will eventuallt be written in js.

# Internet Music-s25-26

HEM Multimedia Master 2025-2026 Dufour GD-41 / online

Haute École de Musique de Genève 


## introduction

Can the Internet be understood as one of the central challenges of our time—an environment to be interpreted, shaped, and re-imagined? This course examines the Internet as a cultural and technological framework for music, from its historical foundations to the most recent browser-based and IoT practices. The emphasis is on the development of multimodal approaches to music writing in which the browser itself becomes an instrument, spanning gamified concert formats, networked and ubiquitous performance, generative and data-driven composition, performative artificial intelligence, and the integration of digital fabrication into musical environments.
Topics range from the philosophical basis of networked systems to advanced applications of Web Audio, interface design, and machine learning for sound. Practical work is carried out in browser-based code editors, with a sustained focus on musical aesthetics and performative research. We will also approach vibe coding for musical purposes, emphasizing attentiveness and  cognitive critical responsibility.
The course is project-driven. Participants maintain individual online repositories (GitHub or Gitpod) to enable collective access and exchange. Each participant may contribute one research presentation during the term, addressing performative, technical, or conceptual aspects of the material, with documentation shared through the participatory web-audio wiki.  Assessment is based on the creation of Internet Music Instruments (IMI), systems, and conceptual frameworks, with the expectation that the work developed will be integrated to the final Master’s project.

Ce cours explore l’Internet comme cadre culturel et technologique de la création musicale. De ses fondations historiques aux pratiques actuelles du Web et de l’IoT, il met l’accent sur le développement d’approches multimodales où le navigateur devient instrument : concerts ludifiés, performance en réseau, composition générative et basée sur les données, intelligence artificielle performative et fabrication numérique. L’enseignement alterne réflexion critique et réalisation pratique, avec pour objectif la conception d’Instruments de Musique Internet (IMI), de systèmes et de cadres conceptuels intégrés au projet final de Master.

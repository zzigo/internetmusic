_"/holdspace"_  is a personal project and it is my first interactive music piece made for the browser.

The idea behind the project was to choose a simple user interaction, in this case holding and releasing the spacebar, and design a music piece around it. This approach allowed me to focus on learning more about Javascript programming language, and more specifically about [Threejs](https://threejs.org/), for the graphics, and [Tonejs](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) for the sound.

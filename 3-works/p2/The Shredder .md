An Alternative web browser that turns web pages into digital confetti.

1998 [potatoland.org/shredder](http://potatoland.org/shredder)

At a time when the web browser struggled against print metaphors like magazine and newspapter to find it’s own identity, The Shredder revealed the “soft” nature of the web. Markup, text, code, images and links are scattered across the screen like an instant Jackson Pollack. The raw material of the web, revealed, torn and tossed onto a heap.

The net artist Mark Napier has written various software that – like Nebula_m81+0.2 – interprets data from the Net and deconstructs itvisually and textually. On his website

*Potatoland* one can try outmany of the programs and participate in multiuser environmentswhere you write, submit url’s or throw digital junk into a spacewhere other people can then experience it. In 1998 he released *Shredder* which is an “art browser” (a browser is a good exampleof software that can become subject to artistic experimentation) thatinterprets the html code of a webpage and displays it in a new andtotally different way where texts and images are taken out of contextand reconstructed into a collage of information. Napier is tryingto make the user aware of the code behind the information that heor she is so accustomed to see in a nicely coded html with tables,layers and embedded objects like images, Flash or Shockwave. Theresult can be a beautiful piece where code, text and images collidein a random collage, but the experience of using it weakens after awhile. There is no point in loading up site after site to experience itsdeconstruction. It is interesting for the rst time, but after a whilethe whole thing becomes pointless.

*Riot* is a similar deconstructive browser to Shredder, but here it is a multiuser environment where thelinks submitted by the last users mix with the links you submit. The browser defragments the html code but the hyperlinks are still activeand within the browser one can browse the Internet in a new way [Thor Magusson, 2003]

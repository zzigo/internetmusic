Acoustic Pressure Piece is an installation in which the visitor passes through twelve and twenty inch spaces wherein Nauman has deadened the registration of sound. The perception of sound (or lack of it) differs according to the viewers proximity to the panels, but the sensory experience is deliberately uncomfortable.

An neverending archive of digital trash. The artist has created an interface, in which the User can copy files from his computer or foreign websites - he can trash them. In a few seconds the files appear in different layers on the monitor. Now you can grab into old lyers of information. Unreadable texts odr icons appear (for example: logo of Yahoo!, Hompepage of the CIA...)

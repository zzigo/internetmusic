"During my 2020 residency at the Library of Congress, I developed [Citizen DJ](https://citizen-dj.labs.loc.gov/) to invite the public to make hip hop music using free-to-use sounds in the Library’s vast collections. One of my deliverables was to create an album of my own music using the tools and resources provided by Citizen DJ, which you can listen to below.

Each song remixes a single item in the Library’s collection called [Inventing Entertainment-The Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies](https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/about-this-collection/). This collection contains early sound recordings on Edison Diamond Discs published between 1912 and 1929. For each new song on the left, you can listen to the source recording that it references on the right. Credits and creative process provided below the tracks.

All the Edison recordings that are referenced are in the public domain. Since I produced the new tracks as a contractor for the federal government, these tracks are also in the public domain, meaning they free to use and reuse without restriction. You can copy, modify, and distribute these works all without asking permission. Attribution (Brian Foo and the Library of Congress) is appreciated but not required."

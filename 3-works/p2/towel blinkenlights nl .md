I usually
start with the first frame in the shot. I then decide how long that
frame needs to be on screen. My player program runs at 15 frames per
second so I copy and paste the frame 15 times for each second it is to
appear. After I have the first frames there are several ways to make the frames for
the rest of the shot. Of course all the ASCII in your frames must appear within the size boundaries you decided on.

Each frame is 67 characters wide and 13 lines high.

The player program was written by me in Java 1.1 and it this that is used to play the asciimation over the WWW.

# Machine Learning with ML 5

There are three main types of machine learning: 

## supervised learning
## unsupervised learning
## reinforcement learning. 

note: Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input example. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the goal is to find patterns or relationships within the data. Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make sequential decisions in an environment, with feedback provided in the form of rewards or penalties.
Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into several types, including

---
### regression algorithms 
for predicting continuous values, 
### classification algorithms
for predicting discrete labels, 
### clustering algorithms 
for finding groups or clusters in data, 
### dimensionality reduction algorithms
for reducing the number of features in a dataset.

To train a machine learning model, we typically split our data into training and testing sets, use the training set to fit the model to the data, and then evaluate its performance on the testing set. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## ML train a classification algorithm


---
we are going to use ML5, a p5's library to make machine learning in the browser.
Today, we will manage a classification algorithm, useful to make translation from one class to other class.

## ML Regression algorythm 

One common regression algorithm in machine learning is linear regression. Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

Other regression algorithms include:

- ==Support Vector Regression (SVR)== which uses support vector machines to perform regression tasks.
- ==Decision Tree Regression== which uses decision tree models to predict the value of a target variable.
- ==Random Forest Regression== which is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance.
- ==Gradient Boosting Regression== which builds an ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees) in a sequential manner to improve predictive performance.

note:These algorithms can be used for various regression tasks such as predicting housing prices, stock prices, or any other continuous variable. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired outcome.

The deployment of music notation tools on the Internet has been investigated since the late 1990s. A first example can be the [Guido Note Server](https://guidoeditor.grame.fr/). After a large number of applications we can mention MuseScore, that also is an open source community sharing their scores on internet. Noteflight, Scorio, LilyBin and the GuidoEditor. All these systems are based on the traditional music notation, not dealing with any problems or paradigms of the networked performances possibilities.

On this late possibilities the work of Georg Hajdu [Quintent.net](http://Quintent.net) is worth to mention, although still based on local Maxmsp patches and symbolic notation.

---
Another example is the Decibel Score Player, based on graphical notation. It allows for the synchronization of the scores of a performing ensemble. In this case is a standalone app on the ipad.

# 1. Classical Player Typologies
>[!tip] These are psychologically driven, not materially or gesturally.
These stem from game studies and behavioral psychology. Examples include:


### Bartle’s Taxonomy (1996) – originally for MUDs, includes:

- _Achievers_ (goal-oriented),
- _Explorers_ (curious),
- _Socializers_ (interaction-driven),
- _Killers_ (competitive/dominant).

- Lazzaro’s 4 Keys to Fun:
    - _Hard Fun_, _Easy Fun_, _Serious Fun_, _People Fun_.

- Marczewski’s Hexad (gamification):
    - _Philanthropist, Free Spirit, Achiever, Player, Socializer, Disruptor_.

Yes, there _absolutely_ is such a thing as player typologies or interactor typologies, and what you’re intuitively describing—like _“painting on the air,” “making a tree,” or “1-person shooter”_—points to a much richer space than classical game design models usually offer. Let’s unpack this in layers, because you’re touching on a territory where _agency_, _gesture_, _semiotic behavior_, _material interaction_, and _symbolic action_ intersect. This is core to defining new grammars for art-videogames or hyperrealities.

# 2. Interaction and Gesture-Based Typologies

These could be formalized into a typology based on sensorial-expressive mappings, not just goals.
toward a different axis: the _modes of interaction_ and _gesture vocabularies_. For example:

|Gesture Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|Air Painting|Free gestural expression, non-indexical input.|
|Trigger-Firing|Point-aim-trigger mechanic, precise execution.|
|Constructive Play|Growing, assembling, evolving structures (e.g. “making a tree”).|
|Embodied Ritual|Repetitive or symbolic actions with meaning beyond outcome.|
|Material Hacking|Changing parameters or rules mid-play (modifying a circuit, patching a synth, etc).|


---
# 3. Ontological / Philosophical Typologies
We could consider typologies based on what kind of _being_ or _becoming_ the interactor embodies:


|Ontological Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|Performer|Treats interaction as gestural, expressive, like dance or music.|
|Author|Constructs a narrative/world; decisions are creative not reactive.|
|Operator|Executes pre-given rules with optimization in mind.|
|Avatarial Host|Becomes other through immersive embodiment.|
|Ritual Agent|Performs actions with symbolic/transformative resonance.|

# 4. Artistic-Videogame Interaction Modes


|Term|Typology Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|“Painting on the air”|Gestural-Expressive|Interaction is spatial, expressive, abstract.|
|“Arcade”|Reflex-Mechanical|High-stakes, reactive, skill-based mechanics.|
|“1-person shooter”|Targeted-Kinesthetic|Ego-centric perspective with goal-driven aggression.|
|“Making a tree”|Generative-Constructive|Procedural growth, craft, emergence over time.|


Each of these could be viewed as an Interactor Type in terms of agency style, affect, and symbolic frame.

## 5. Toward a Taxonomy for Hyperrealities

building custom typologies for interactive art, you might think in multidimensional axes:

- Agency Type: constructive / destructive / performative / contemplative
- Temporal Mode: real-time / turn-based / timeless / durational
- Feedback Loop: direct / oblique / ambiguous / non-existent
- Symbolic Frame: simulation / metaphor / ritual / abstract
- Materiality: physicalized / haptic / virtual / speculative
- Sociability: solitary / dialogic / collective / anonymous

1. **Selection of a mundane object**  
   - Choose an object from daily life, stripped of overt artistic intention (e.g., a urinal, a shovel, a bottle rack).
2. **Displacement from functional context**  
   - Remove the object from its habitual use-context. This severs its utilitarian affordances and social function.
3. **Reframing within an art-system context**  
   - Place the object in a gallery, museum, or artistic frame. This activates the institutional and cultural gaze.
4. **Minimal intervention (optional)**  
   - Sign, rotate, invert, or slightly modify the object—not to alter its structure, but to trigger semiotic tension (e.g., Duchamp signs it “R. Mutt”).
5. **Trigger perceptual estrangement**  
   - By forcing the viewer to re-encounter the object as an artwork, the work initiates a break in perceptual habits. This recontextualization demands new aesthetic, philosophical, and political interpretations.
6. **Generate meta-commentary**  
   - The piece becomes a reflection not just of the object, but of the **system of art**, **authorship**, and **perception** itself.
### Key Concepts
- **Defamiliarization**: forcing the viewer to see the ordinary as strange.
- **Readymade**: Duchamp’s term for a mass-produced object designated as art.
- **Decontextualization**: removing something from its original context to alter meaning.
- **Perceptual estrangement**: a break in the automated act of recognition.
- **Aesthetic shift**: reassigning value or status to an object by framing it.

## **Aesthetic Procedure: Real-Virtual Object Translation**

1. **Selection of a culturally charged or sensorially rich object**  
   - Choose an object that possesses strong affordances, symbolic weight, or historical significance (e.g., a musical instrument, a mask, a tool, a totemic item).

2. **Transposition across ontological domains**  
   - Digitally scan, model, or simulate the object in AR/VR space — or fabricate a physical instantiation of a previously virtual object. This transposition breaks the original's singular materiality.

3. **Preservation of formal identity, transformation of medium**  
   - Maintain recognizable structure, but alter scale, texture, responsiveness, or presence (e.g., ghostly transparency in AR, exaggerated materiality in 3D print).

4. **Insertion into a perceptual hybrid context**  
   - Situate the object within an augmented or mixed-reality scene where real and virtual elements co-exist, clash, or fuse. This creates ontological tension in the viewer’s sensorium.

5. **Induce cognitive and affective ambiguity**  
   - Trigger questions about what is “real,” “copy,” “ritual,” or “artifact.” The viewer is led to oscillate between perception modes (touchable vs untouchable, embodied vs remote, ephemeral vs lasting).

6. **Reflexive re-signification**  
   - The object is no longer just *what it is*, but becomes a **commentary on mediation, indexicality, and material memory**. It may acquire new symbolic, aesthetic, or political charge depending on its trajectory across domains.

SaaS

 SaaS stands for Software as a Service. It is a cloud computing model in which software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of installing and maintaining software on individual computers or servers, users can access and use the software through a web browser. SaaS providers typically handle all maintenance, updates, and security of the software, allowing users to focus on using the application rather than managing it. Examples of SaaS include customer relationship management [[CRM]] systems like Salesforce, project management tools like Asana, and email marketing platforms like Mailchimp.

## introduction

We understand cryptography as the construction of a secret, that in most cases is used for secure communication in the presence of an adversary.

The ****ECDSA****

- Ownership
    
    One reason bitcoin can be confusing for beginners is that the technology behind it redefines the concept of ownership. To own something in the traditional sense, be it a house or a sum of money, means either having personal custody of the thing or granting custody to a trusted entity such as a bank.
    
    With bitcoin the case is different. Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. To “own” a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain

    After a boom in Compact Disks sales in the 1990s, online music service Napster disrupted traditional distribution methods in the music industry. Being founded in 1999 as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet service sharing digital audio songs in MP3 format, it paved the way for today’s world of streaming services. Napster offered downloads over the web, and made almost any music free to download. This had greatly affected the revenue of artists and record labels because each track had to be worth the same price for a user.
    
    In the early 2000s, individual song and album sales continued to decline, and copyright holders began looking for streaming services that could pay for them per “play” or “listen” through ad revenue or monthly subscriptions. Today the music industry belongs to streaming, and now that the format has established itself as a saviour and the future of business, more and more streaming platforms are appearing.

NFT - New Realities and new economies

non-fungible tokens, as a blockchain-based digital material exclusivity contract, introduced scarcity to the world of art and digital collectibles.

- Joselit, NFTs, or The Readymade Reversed
    
    Marcel Duchamp prooved in 1913-15 that a quantum of information, could disorganize the objectivity of a snow shovel by transposing it as art. With the readymade of Fountain, 1917, Duchamp gave sculpture over to information on two registers: He desublimated matter by suspending it between two names, shovel and sculpture; and he abandoned objects for discourse. Desublimation and abandonment.
    
    The NFT arrival, reverse the duchampial gesture, as the clousure of the information’s commodification cycle fundamental to late capitalism.

    Beeple, Mike Winkelmann, 2021, 21x21 kpixels
    
    a collage of 5000 digital images created by Beeple, sold by 69 musd. a large, square image file (21,069 by 21,069 pixels). It’s a digital mosaic composed of images that Beeple has released on the web, one a day, since May 1, 2007. This “Everydays” series is more or less the digital equivalent of a sketchbook, though what Beeple can whip up with 3D graphics gets more and more elaborate as we get closer to the present.
    
    NFT means a deployment of an ideological mechanism: an open, mobile production is made into private property, sysceptible to speculation. Art becomes non-fungible, exactly the opposite of a ready made.
    
    This piece was buyed by a programmer and crypto-trader called Metakovan, who declared:
    
    > We hope to work with some of the best architects on the planet to design something truly worthy of this masterpiece. . . . Unlike the Mona Lisa that’s in physical space, this is purely digital. So we intend to create a monument that this particular piece deserves, which can exist only in the metaverse.2
    
    Duchamp → art as a category of materiality freedom from commodiafiable form
    
    NFT → art as a category of the private extraction of the available information freedom.

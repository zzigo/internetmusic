#glossary 


TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a protocol that is used for transmitting data over the internet. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets between applications on different hosts. It ensures that data is delivered in the same order as it was sent and that any missing or corrupt packets are retransmitted. TCP also manages congestion control to prevent network congestion and ensure efficient delivery of data. It is widely used in applications such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and streaming media.

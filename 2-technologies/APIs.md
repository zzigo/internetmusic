#glossary 

 An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define how different software components should interact, what functions they can perform, and what data they can exchange.

APIs are used to enable integration between different applications, systems, or platforms. They provide a standardized way for developers to access specific functionality or data from external services or libraries without having to understand the internal workings of those services.

There are various types of APIs:

1. Web APIs: These are APIs that are accessed over the internet using HTTP protocols. They allow developers to access web-based services such as social media platforms, payment gateways, weather data providers, etc.

2. Operating System APIs: These APIs provide access to various operating system functions and resources such as file systems, network connections, device drivers, etc. Developers use these APIs to build applications that run on specific operating systems like Windows API or POSIX API.

3. Library/APIs: These are pre-built sets of functions and procedures that developers can use to add specific functionality into their own applications. Examples include graphics libraries like OpenGL or database libraries like JDBC.

4. Hardware/APIs: Hardware manufacturers often provide APIs that allow developers to interact with their hardware devices such as sensors, cameras, printers, etc. These hardware APIs enable developers to build software applications that utilize the capabilities of the hardware.

APIs play a crucial role in modern software development by enabling interoperability and integration between different applications and systems. They simplify the development process by providing standardized interfaces for accessing external services or resources.

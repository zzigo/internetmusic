#glossary 

Many networks are structured into [[Client]]/[[server]] relationships. This is also true for most of [[the web]]. The typical client from which we access [[the web]] is a [[browser]].

Clients send requests to servers to retrieve information. In case of the [[the web]] the client sends [[HTTP]] requests using [[Uniform Resource Locators]] or short **URL**s. There are different [types of request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) but most commonly we will encounter the `GET` request, which is responsible for fetching a resource - such as a website - form the [[server]].

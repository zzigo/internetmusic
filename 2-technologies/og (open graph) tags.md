open graph tags 

Open Graph tags are meta tags that can be added to web pages to provide structured data about the content of the page. These tags are used by social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to display rich previews when a link is shared on their platforms.

Some common Open Graph tags include:

- og:title: The title of the content being shared.
- og:description: A brief description of the content.
- og:image: The URL of an image to be displayed with the shared link.
- og:url: The canonical URL of the page being shared.
- og:type: The type of content (e.g. article, video, product).

By including Open Graph tags on your website, you can control how your content appears when it is shared on social media, increasing engagement and visibility.

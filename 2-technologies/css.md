 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a styling language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML, XHTML, or XML. CSS allows developers to separate the content of a webpage from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.

CSS consists of rules that define how elements should be displayed on a webpage. These rules include selectors that target specific elements, properties that specify the visual appearance of those elements, and values that determine the specific characteristics.

CSS can be used to control various aspects of web design, such as typography (font size, color, spacing), layout (positioning and sizing of elements), colors and backgrounds (background color or image), borders and boxes (border style, width), and more.

CSS can be applied inline within HTML elements using the "style" attribute, embedded within an HTML document using the "style" tag in the head section, or linked externally to an HTML document using the "link" tag.

Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web developers to create visually appealing and responsive websites.

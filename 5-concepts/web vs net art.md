Olia Lialina pointing out the difference between net and web art, where she preferes net art.

Mark Voge:
"Web Art" Versus "Net Art" 

 I think the difference between the two expressions is simple. "Web art" happens on a
 Web site. "Net art" happens on the Internet. This means that the second expression
 encompasses the first one. It also means that Net art happens not just on Web sites, but
 anywhere else on the Internet, for instance in E-mail. I've chosen to use the expression
 "Web art" simply because all the artists' works I studied for Web Project 8 were on Web
 sites. In any case, whether the art work is on a Web site or in an E-mail, the terms "Web
 art" and "Net art" seem interchangeable.

Definition. CI and CD stand forÂ **continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment**. In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.

CD, on the other hand, is the process of automatically deploying these code changes to production servers. This allows for faster and more efficient development cycles, as developers can quickly see the impact of their changes and react accordingly.

CI/CD technologies help automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. Some popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions.

Overall, CI/CD technologies are essential for modern software development practices to ensure that code changes are delivered quickly and reliably to meet the demands of today's fast-paced development environments.


# components code organization

Components code organization refers to the way in which different parts of a software application or system are structured and grouped together based on their functionality or purpose. This organization helps developers to effectively manage and maintain the codebase, as well as improve collaboration and scalability in the development process.

There are several common ways to organize components code in a software application, such as:

1. Modular structure: Divide the codebase into separate modules or components based on their functionality. Each module should have a clear responsibility and be independent of other modules.

2. Component-based architecture: Organize the code into reusable and self-contained components that can be easily integrated into different parts of the application. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.

3. Folder structure: Use a consistent folder structure to group related components, styles, assets, and other files together. This makes it easier to navigate through the codebase and locate specific files when needed.

4. Separation of concerns: Separate different concerns such as presentation logic, business logic, data fetching, and styling into separate files or folders. This helps to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

5. Naming conventions: Use meaningful and descriptive names for components, files, folders, variables, and functions to improve readability and understandability of the code.

6. Documentation: Provide clear documentation for each component describing its purpose, usage, props (if applicable), dependencies, and any other relevant details.

By following these best practices for organizing component code in a software application, developers can create a more maintainable and scalable codebase that is easier to work with and understand.

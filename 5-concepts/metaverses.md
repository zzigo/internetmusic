# Introduction

- The term comes straight out of Neal Stephenson's 1980s novel Snowcrash. It is a cousin of William Gibson's term cyberspace, which became relatively important in the 1990s with the internet, although it was not used commercially.
- The term tries to define a transversal virtual reality platform where economy and leisure can be combined. Similar to what is seen in films like 'Ready Player One' (and its original book and many other CF books).
- Is not a new idea, you may remember Second Life. But with each iteration more solid attributes and technical possibilities are added. In this opportunity the new ones are blockchain and VR.
- It is an environment in which things are not what they are, but what they seem. But whose fiction has the limit of real dollars. The generation of 'virtualised and virtualising virtual economies' whose application is on platforms similar to video games.
- Between the tokenized games, three are those which have more possibilities to grow:
    - upland
        - buying lands and properties tied to real world
    - decentraland
    - the sandbox
- Other platforms more focused on einterteinment, in Lua allows users create own video games.
    - Roblox
        - created in 2004-06 by Erik Cassell and David Baszucki originally called DynaBlocks.
    - Rec Room
- Is it imaginable to deal with a dollarised, tokenised economy that is supported by a video game? Such a scenario is feasible and, even if the 'Metaverse' is not exactly realised, the vectors of development have a definite orientation. The 'gamification' of the economy and the Real World is a project.
- Fornite: **Live Events**  are events that occur within the match that connects to the [story line](https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Lore_(Battle_Royale))  of Fortnite. They usually occur in the middle or near the end of the season. Some events involve turning off shooting, so everyone can enjoy the event. Sometimes, build is still enabled, so players can build up and get a better view. 4/23/2020 - Travis Scott

                It is a work by Andrea Pozzo, an Italian painter, architect and baroque art theorist, which seeks to represent the work carried out by the Jesuits in evangelising the world. The painting, 17 metres in diameter, merges with the architecture in such a way that when the observer looks at a point marked by a yellow copper disc, the ceiling ceases to exist to give way to a sky covered with clouds and angelic figures. It exalts the figure of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who is placed at the centre of the composition.
                
                Pozzo's decorations set the standard for ceiling frescoes throughout Catholic Europe and were widely imitated in the churches of the Jesuit order in Italy, Austria, Germany and Central Europe. His work constitutes the final stage in the dissemination of the perspectival technique, through a teaching plan easily applicable to any field of architecture and painting, in which the optical-perceptual tradition and geometrical-mathematical mastery converge. Its legacy goes back to contemporary augmented, virtual and mixed reality devices, as well as the fulldome projection format.

        > instead of simply presenting the world, they show it in a dislocated way, until finally the human being begins to live according to the images created by himself. [...] Man forgets that he produces images in order to find his way in the world: now he tries to find his way with them. He no longer deciphers his own images, but lives according to them; imagination has become hallucination (Flusser, 2014: 15).
